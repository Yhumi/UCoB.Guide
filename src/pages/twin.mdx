## Overview
[Overall Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/9WEG4AEGVdru3hyF)  
Twintania has 3 separate mini-phases, governed by HP thresholds,
which dictate the mechanic loop that Twintania executes. These HP
thresholds are:  
<Button class="btn btn-primary-light" href="#h-hp-threshold-1-100-75">100%-75%</Button>
<Button class="btn btn-secondary-light" href="#h-hp-threshold-2-749-45">74.9%-45%</Button>
<Button class="btn btn-highlighter" href="#hp-threshold-3-449-01">44.9%-0.1%</Button>  

<ImageWrapperSquare img={neurolinkpuddle} alt="Neurolink puddle" classdiv="mt-8"/>
**Neurolink** - Small puddle that is dropped under the center of Twintania's hitbox
upon hitting a HP threshold  
When a player steps into the Neurolink, the player gets
a <BuffDebuff name="Neurolink" img={neurolink} /> debuff, which reduces damage done by approximately 90% and
healing done by approximately 10%. This debuff will be required to resolve the **Generate** mechanic
explained later in this page.  

<NASpecific>
The Neurolink puddles will need to be spread out for the resolution of mechanics in this phase and future phases.
NA drops these puddles in a counter-clockwise order, starting from North to Southwest to Southeast. If you're using
the recommended markers, it is on the 1, 2, and 3 markers, in order.
</NASpecific>


## Timeline Breakdown
### HP Threshold 1 (100%-75%)
<Card title="Mechanic Loop">
    - Plummet  
    - Twister  
    - Fireball  
    - Death Sentence
    - Plummet
    - Twister
    - Fireball
</Card>

- **Plummet** - Conal physical mini-tankbuster aimed at the player that is highest in aggro, no cast time  


<ImageWrapperSquare img={twister} alt="Twister" classdiv="mt-8"/>

- **Twister** - Drops small tornadoes (Twisters) under 4 players near the end of the cast  
If a player touches a Twister, it will immediately kill the player who touched the Twister. Additionally,
any players within the vicinity of the Twister will take lethal damage and be knocked back into the wall.
Dodge Twisters by moving away from your initial position at about 75% of the cast till the cast ends (Latency
dependent).


<ImageWrapperSquare img={fireball} alt="Fireball marker" classdiv="mt-8"/>

- **Fireball** - Targeted party stack on marked player  
It is common to 5 stack the Fireball in the opener with 4 DPS and 1 healer to generate LB for a future phase. 
Both tanks and 1 healer (discuss with your party) will stay out of this initial stack. Subsequent Fireball stacks
should be stacked with as many people as possible.[^1]
  
- **Death Sentence** - Tankbuster (Forced tankswap) which inflicts 
a <BuffDebuff name="Slashing Resistance Down II" img={slashing} /> on the target  
Forced swap as Twintania's autos are slashing type. If the player that currently has 
the <BuffDebuff name="Slashing Resistance Down II" img={slashing} /> takes an auto, they will take lethal
damage.  

Most parties will usually hit the next HP threshold after the Death Sentence or 2nd Plummet in the loop.

### HP Threshold 2 (74.9%-45%)
<Card title="Mechanic Loop">
    - Liquid Hells  
    - Generate  
    - Liquid Hells  
    - Death Sentence 
    - Generate  
    - Twister
    - Plummet
</Card>

- **Liquid Hells** - A set of 5x puddles, baited sequentially on the targeted player  
Each puddle is a moderately-sized circle which applies <BuffDebuff name="Burns" img={burns} />, a lethal DoT,
to any players who stand in the puddle for too long.  
The targeted player is any single player between the radius of about 10-25 yalms. If there are multiple valid
targets, a random player within the valid radius is chosen as the target for a single Liquid Hell.

- **Generate** - Marks 1-3 players for an orb that follows the location of the player till the orb is intercepted  
An orb is also referred to as a **Hatch**. *In this phase*, only DPS players can get marked for a Hatch.
The number of players marked is determined by the number of Neurolinks that are currently on the arena.  
When an orb is intercepted, the orb will explode and deal lethal damage to players in the immediate vicinity who
do not have the <BuffDebuff name="Neurolink" img={neurolink} /> debuff, attained from standing in a Neurolink.
The people in the vicinity of the explosion who survive will 
get <BuffDebuff name="Mana Hypersensitivity" img={manahyper} /> for 16 seconds, making any Hatch-related damage
lethal during the duration of the debuff with or without the <BuffDebuff name="Neurolink" img={neurolink} /> debuff.   
If the person who intercepted the orb dies, usually when they do not have
the <BuffDebuff name="Neurolink" img={neurolink} /> debuff on intercept, the orb will further explode, dealing
lethal raidwide damage and applying <BuffDebuff name="Damage Down" img={damagedown} /> to any surviving players.
The same result will occur when nobody intercepts the orb when 10 seconds have passed since the end of the
Generate cast.  
  
The second set of Liquid Hells in this mechanic loop will happen ***during*** the resolution of the Hatch. 
Likewise, the Twister in this set will happen during the resolution of the Hatch. See
[the section on hatches](#hatches) for more info.


### HP Threshold 3 (44.9%-0.1%)
<Card title="Mechanic Loop">
    - Liquid Hells  
    - Generate  
    - Liquid Hells (random) + Fireball  
    - Death Sentence  
    - Plummet  
    - Generate  
    - Twister  
    - Plummet  
</Card>

- **Liquid Hells (random)** - Same as Liquid Hells, but instead of a random target within a preset range, it is
a random single target for all 5 puddles.  
  
  
## Role Breakdown and Tips
### Tank
Take care to face the plummet away from the party or even rogue players that may be standing in the cleaved area.
#### Positioning and Uptime 
Tanks can do a lot to make the melee DPS' life a lot easier such as:
- Standing where the other tank is standing when provoking from them, keeping the boss facing the same way
- Positioning Twintania closer to the Neurolinks temporarily. [Example 1](example) & [Example 2](example)
  

### Healer
Some people may not stack for Fireball stacks, so be prepared to throw out a shield or mitigation.
  

### DPS
#### Hatches
<ImageWrapperSquare img={hatchresolve} alt="Hatch resolution from the side" />
Since the <BuffDebuff name="Neurolink" img={neurolink} /> debuff reduces damage done by the player,
minimizing the amount of time spent in the Neurolink to resolve Hatches is ideal. However, due to the way
snapshots and latency work, it is recommended to **walk into the Neurolink from the side** instead of walking
into the Neurolink directly towards the Hatch in this phase.

<NASpecific>
    For the Generate + Liquid Hell combo, if the Liquid Hell baiter (**physical ranged**) gets marked for a Hatch,
    it is common to have someone else (**caster**) intercept the Hatch for the baiter.  
    In conjunction with baiting Liquid Hells, positioning for this correctly without causing a death or wipe can be 
    tricky. Use [this raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/19yavfslOUU0l1Gp) or check out this useful video that will
    help you prepare for this!
    <YouTube id="9DDTla_pbL0" />
</NASpecific>

For the Generate + Twister combo, Twister will usually go off before the orb reaches you. Make sure you drop
the twister outside of the Neurolink to ensure your end position is safe.
